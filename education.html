            <p>I am a life long learner, between K-12 and college, I have been enrolled in an educational institution for 27 years of my life. Aside from this formal education, I spend most of my free time also learning about new technologies, philosophy, automotive maintenance, economics, and so many other fascinating aspects of life and the world. On this page, I'll focus only on my formal education.</p>

                Doctor of Philosophy
                <br>Electrical and Computer Engineering
                <br>Mississippi State University
                <br>GPA 4.0/4.0 Expected May 2027
            </h3>
            <p>After receiving my master's degree in 2018, I felt as though I was not finished with academia. However, because I was working full time, I was finished with attending classes in person. So, I went off to find a remote PhD program in electrical engineering. In 2018, I could only find two options, Mississippi State University and Columbia. Mississippi State would take my master's degree credits, and Columbia wouldn't, so it was an easy choice.
            <br><br>I started in Spring of 2019 and began a four year pursuit to finish coursework requirements. Coursework was focused in digital signal processing, adaptive filters, neural networks and machine learning. When those requirements were complete at the end of 2023, I began research under Dr. Chaomin Luo in the Robotics and Intelligent Systems group. My research topic is bio-inspired path planning algorithms with applications in robotics -- rooted in the cognitive map.
            <br><br>As of today, I am working to complete my research. I have published a journal paper in IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems (TCDS), a conference paper in IEEE Conference in Evolutionary Computation (CEC), and I've just submitted another conference paper to IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO).

            <p>After completing my bachelor's degree I immediately enrolled into the master's program at UWB. My focus was with embedded system design and embedded software, but took additional coursework in statistics, digital signal processing, image processing, and CMOS fabrication.</p>

            <p>After separating honorably from the US Navy, I used the post 9-11 GI Bill to earn my BSEE. Additionally, I minored in computing software and systems (computer science). My elective coursework and senior project were geared toward embedded software development on microcontrollers.</p>

                AAS - Electronics Technology Equivalency
                <br>United States Navy
            </h3>
            <p>After high school I joined the Navy as an electronics technician. Core school was an 8-week, 40 hour/week lab-based electronics course where I learned about analog circuits and had laboratory exercises to: build circuits; measure current, resistance, and voltage with a digital multimeter; use oscilloscopes to measure aspects of circuits; and configure power supplies and power meters.</p>
            <p>After core school, was 'A' school, a self-paced 17-week program designed to teach sailors about radar and communication systems. I read technical manuals and troubleshot and repaired radars and radios in a laboratory environment. I was the first ever sailor to complete this newly adopted self-paced learning curriculum, and I completed it in 11 weeks.</p>
            <p>After 'A' school, was 'C' school. Every 'C' school focused on a different system or skill and was intended to specialize a sailor on a specific piece of equipment or skill, with the intention they would use this knowledge/skill throughout their career. My first 'C' school was for the WSC-6(v)9 Super High Frequency (SHF) satellite communication terminal, an 8-week course on operating, troubleshooting, and repairing the system. This system was responsible for serving ships with non-secure and secure internet. Additionally, I attended a 4-week 'C' school in miniature electronics repair, involving the soldering of numerous types of components and IC packages, and PCB repair.</p>

                I worked for my last 3 years of high school, first as a licensed title clerk for just over a year transferring titles on vehicles/vessels and renewing registrations. Then for my last 1.5 years of high school, I worked as a machinist apprentice, operating manual mills/lathes and a CNC mill to machine parts to specification. I did this all while attending high school and taking advanced placement courses in math and science.</p>
