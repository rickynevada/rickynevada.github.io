                Experience
            </h2>
            <p>I began my career nearly 20 years ago, first as a technician, then as an engineer, and lately I have been focused on engineering leadership, project management, and research. The following is a comprehensive timeline of my experience over the years.</p>
             <h3>
                Software Engineering Manager
                <br>The Allen Institute | Seattle, WA
                <br>Nov. 2024 - Present
            </h3>
            <p>I started at the Allen Institute in 2024 during a re-organization. A software team was forming from individuals across the institute with a goal of developing software for scientific instrumentation and experimental platforms. I facilitated the team's collaborate effort to define and implement standard professional software and project management processes. Standards were then used to: design custom hardware and embedded software for microcontroller based devices; develop standalone GUI applications; transfer data at large scale; and create cloud computing infrastructure. Additional responsbilities include contract management, resourcing, project management, and performance evaluation and career development.</p>
            <h3>
                Software Engineering Associate Manager
                <br>Lockheed Martin Corporation | Bothell, WA
                <br>Nov. 2022 - Nov. 2024
                <br>Staff Firmware Engineer
                <br>May. 2018 - 2022
            </h3>

            <p>Software Manager -- Helped to create and cultivate the first ever software team at LM Laser & Sensor Systems. Lead and managed the 13 software and firmware engineers in the development of control software for high energy lasers and their subsystems from early concept architecture to delivery. I also engaged in project management, staffing, architecture and design reviews, proposals, and performance evaluations.</p>

            <p>Staff Firmware Engineer -- I began at Lockheed as a level 2 engineer and left as a level 4 staff engineer. I was the primary engineer responsible for the delivery of multiple embedded software projects for custom electronics used in numerous systems delivered to customers. Two of the largest programs I supported were Lance and HELIOS. I participated in proposals, budgetting and cost estimate, architecture development and review, development, test, and integration. Engineering work was a mix of C code for microcontroller based embedded systems running real-time operating systems (RTOS) and no operating systems (bare metal), and SoC's running Linux and C++ applications.</p>
