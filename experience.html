                Experience
            </h2>
            <p>I began my career nearly 20 years ago, first as a technician, then as an engineer, and lately I have been focused on engineering leadership, project management, and research. The following is a comprehensive timeline of my experience over the years.</p>
             <h3>
                Software Engineering Manager
                <br>The Allen Institute | Seattle, WA
                <br>Nov. 2024 - Present
            </h3>
            <p>I started at the Allen Institute in 2024 during a re-organization. A software team was forming from individuals across the institute with a goal of developing software for scientific instrumentation and experimental platforms. I facilitated the team's collaborate effort to define and implement standard professional software and project management processes. Standards were then used to: design custom hardware and embedded software for microcontroller based devices; develop standalone GUI applications; transfer data at large scale; and create cloud computing infrastructure. Additional responsbilities include contract management, resourcing, project management, and performance evaluation and career development.</p>
            <h3>
                Software Engineering Associate Manager
                <br>Lockheed Martin Corporation | Bothell, WA
                <br>Nov. 2022 - Nov. 2024
            </h3>
            <p>Helped to create and cultivate the first ever software team at LM Laser & Sensor Systems. Lead and managed the 13 software and firmware engineers in the development of control software for high energy lasers and their subsystems from early concept architecture to delivery. I also engaged in project management, staffing, architecture and design reviews, proposals, and performance evaluations.</p>
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.congress.gov/crs_external_products/IF/PDF/IF12421/IF12421.1.pdf">IFPC HEL</a> was the largest program I supported.
            <h3>
                Senior Software Engineer
                <br>Kymeta Corporation | Bothell, WA
                <br>Jan. 2022 - Nov. 2022
            </h3>
            <p>I joined Kymeta to help the "pointing and tracking team" with developing and testing LEO and GEO tracking solutions for their electronically steerable antenna system. However, soon after I joined, the team began dissolving with another internal group taking over development of the new LEO tracking solution. In conjunction with Lockheed offering me an incredible opportunity to step into management, my time at Kymeta was cut short.</p>
            <h3>
                Staff Firmware Engineer
                <br>Lockheed Martin Corporation | Bothell, WA
                <br>May. 2018 - Jan. 2022
            </h3>
            <p>I began at Lockheed as a level 2 engineer and left as a level 4 staff engineer. I was the primary engineer responsible for the delivery of multiple embedded software projects for custom electronics used in numerous systems delivered to customers. Two of the largest programs I supported were Lance and HELIOS. I participated in proposals, budgetting and cost estimate, architecture development and review, development, test, and integration. Engineering work was a mix of C code for microcontroller based embedded systems running real-time operating systems (RTOS) and no operating systems (bare metal), and SoC's running Linux and C++ applications.</p>
