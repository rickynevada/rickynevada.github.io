                Welcome to my portfolio website!
            </h2>
            <p>
            Hi, I'm Matt. I've been using computers since my Dad brought home an Epson Equity when I was a kid, and I was hooked to electronics ever since. As a child and early teenager I would tinker around in DOS, Windows 3.1 and Windows 95, installing software, configuring operating systems, and upgrading hardware like graphics cards and modems. In high school when Windows XP was in its prime, I was creating websites, designing video game levels in Duke Nukem 3D, computer drafting, and connecting friends to networks at LAN parties so we could play Counter-Strike mod for Half Life, Diablo II, and Quake 3 Arena.
            <br>
            <br>Through high school I worked as a licensed title clerk for a license agency in Washington State. Transfering titles and renewing people's registrations. I was very fortunate to land such a position as a 16 year old. During my last year of high school I worked at a local machine shop, I learned to use a manual mill and lathe, CNC mill, learned all about tooling, and did some CNC programming in BobCAD. It was again, a really great experience for a teenager.
            <br>
            <br>After high school I enlisted in the US Navy as an electronics technician, where I spent six years of my life learning to fix, repair, and troubleshoot countless different types of communication and RADAR systems -- among other activities like damage control, seamanship, armed security, and yes, the janitorial arts. I was formally trained on the WSC-6(v)9 Super High Frequency (SHF) satellite communication system that was responsible for delivering secured and non-secure internet to my ship's crew aboard the USS Ramage DDG-61, on which I spent 4 years living/stationed on. I also worked on some other radios, HF, VHF, and UHF, and their associated antenna systems in addition to interior communication systems. Finally, I went to a month long soldering and PCB repair school.
            <br>
            <br>At some point during my service I became interested in going to college. I thought so many of the systems I worked on were ingenious, and I wanted to be a part of teams making those systems. Therefore, when my enlistment was up, I got out and came back home. With the financial support of the post 9-11 GI Bill, I received my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering with a minor in computer & software systems (computer science). For most of my undergraduate work I did not need to work, but the last two years I did, so I picked up a job at a local application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) company. There I worked with ASIC designers and engineers to help test and validate ASICs. It was an incredible experience, I learned so much from that team. Between the Arduino I picked up at RadioShack around this time, and the ASIC job, this is about the time I began falling in love with microcontrollers and embedded systems.
            <br>
            <br>Through my senior year in undergrad I focused more on embedded software, selecting projects and classes that fueled my interest. By the time I finished, I'd worked with several different microcontroller tool chains, developed single-handedly countless codebases both professionally and academically, and got into GUI dev too (Java Swing/FX and Android).
            <br>
            <br>This was pretty much the start of my engineering career. From there I had several other jobs where I improved on my software development skills, general engineering skills (systems, mechanical, optical, and electrical), and leadership skills. To where I find myself today, facilitating the design and development of software by inspiring people to ask questions, understand the problem and solution thoroughly, architect the best system through research and trade studies, and develop software with clean code principles. All while engaging and communicating effectively with stakeholders and team members to ensure projects run timely and successfully.
            <br>
            <br>In parallel to my professional growth, I have been in college since 2010. First obtaining my bachelor's in EE (2015), then my master's in EE (2018), and embarking on a journey toward a PhD in ECE (starting 2019). I estimate I'm about 80% complete with my PhD at this point, having completed all coursework and exams. I'm currently in a research/publishing phase with only a journal paper requirement remaining, and then it's to the dissertation defense. Graduation is expected by the end of spring term 2027.
            <br>
            <br>Aside from work and school, my hobbies have morphed over the years, but since I spend so much time programming and designing boards for work and school, I've become a bit of a gear head during my free time. So now I work on motorcycles and cars. I like that it's technical, keeps me time away from the screen, and is somewhat physical.</p>
