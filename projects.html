			<p>Below are some of my academic, personal, and professional projects I had the foresight (and was allowed) to document.  A couple honorable mentions I did that are lost forever:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>PSoC 5 Electronic Flute</b> - Used an air pressure sensor to change the amplitude of sound generated by an 8-bit wave DAC.  Passed through an audio amplifier to a speaker.  The original prototype and inspiration behind the <a href="voydophone.html">Voydophone</a>.</li>
				<li><b>Space Perps</b> - An arcade style shooter written in Java.  I really wish I still had this to show off and play. It was the first large software program I ever developed, complete with sounds and custom graphics. I fell crazy in love with Java and programming after my first programming class in 2012 and over winter break (prior to having to start work again), knocked this out in two weeks.</li>
			</ul>

            <h2>Academic</h2>
			<h3>Goal-Directed Cognitive Map</h3>
			<p>The robotics path planning and navigation algorithm I developed as part of school. Completely bio-inspired. First journal paper getting ready for submission.</p><br>

 			<h3>Arduino Frequency Counter</h3>
			<p>A project I did senior year at UWB.  More details <a href="arduino_fc.html">here</a></p><br>

			<h3>Random number generators</h3>
			<p>Created during the second course in a series on embedded system design.  I made several different random number generators using a PSoC 5, created a GUI to stream in the numbers and plot distributions, and then ran some tests to characterize the quality of the RNGs.  GUI written in Java using the JavaFX framework.  Click <a href="docs/BEE526_Project_Paper.pdf" download>here</a> for the full report.</p><br>

            <h2>Personal</h2>
			<h3>MicroMod</h3>
			<p>Wanted to use a different MCU for the Voydophone since the Delfino is over $20. Settled on one of the newest Piccolo MCU for $6 that has what is called a control law accelerator (CLA), a co-processor that will allow me to offload audio synthesize from the main processor. Decided to modularize Voydophone development for quicker evaluation and spinning of circuits.</p><br>
			<img src="images/MicroMod.jpg" alt="MicroMod" width="50%">
     
			<h3>ChargeMod</h3>
			<p>Voydophone needs a rechargeable battery circuit. Put reverse battery protection in after frying the last Voydophone...</p><br>
			<img src="images/ChargeMod.jpg" alt="ChargeMod" width="50%">

			<h3>3-axis gimbal with face tracking</h3>
			<p>A project I did for an independent study/research at UWB. Uses a commercial 3-axis gimbal that has an API exposed over UART to allow external control of the gimbal.  I hooked up a PSoC 4 with BLE to route data from my Android phone, then I developed the Android App using a face tracking API to command position of the gimbal.  Got it to work, but ran out of time in the quarter to implement any filtering or a control system to smooth out the movement.</p><br>

			<h3>A falling block game</h3>
			<p>Made my own falling block game for Android to avoid watching ads on other similar falling block games...</p><br>

			<h3>Standard Calculator</h3>
			<p>Another oldie.</p><br>

			<h3>Custom Computers</h3>
            <p>I have built over 6 custom computers at this point, but here's my first one:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Lian Li OC11 Dynamic Case</li>
				<li>EVGA SuperNOVA 850W G+ 80 Plus Power Supply</li>
				<li>ASUS Prime Pro X570</li>
				<li>AMD Ryzen 5 3600 - Overclocked to 4.2GHz all cores</li>
				<li>Corsair Vengeance Pro - 32GB 3200MHz DDR4 CL16</li>
				<li>AMD Radeon RX5600XT 6GB GDDR6 RAM - Overclocked 1820MHz</li>
				<li>500GB NVMe SSD</li>
				<li>500GB SSD</li>
				<li>AIO Cooler</li>
			</ul>

                Yamaha R3
            </h3>
            <p>
                The R3 was one of the most modifiable bikes I ever had, and I did loads of work on it. I bought it with 800 miles on it and sold it with 5,600. Here's a list of everything I did if I can remember:
            </p>

                <li>TST worx package (Velocity stacks, AIS block offs, air box mods, K&N filter + Dyno Tune from 2 Wheel Dyno), put out 42HP peak</li>

            </h3>
            <p>
                The guy who sold me the R3 Ohlins suspension parts also had a completely destroyed SV650s that he sold me for cheap, first photo is how he dropped it off at my house, the second photo is when I sold it. Again, tons of mods and maintenance work:
                <ul>
                    <li>Loads of electrical work to get it to start and lights to work.</li>
                    <li>Replaced fuel lines.</li>
                    <li>All new fluids and filters</li>

            <h2>Professional</h2>

			<h3>First board I ever designed</h3>
			<p>Has a PIC32MZ, some boost circuits, external ADC, analog switch ICs, and multiplexer.  I wrote the firmware for it and a Java GUI using JavaFX that controlled it over USB CDC.</p><br>
			<img src="images/first_board.jpg" alt="My First Board" width="50%">

			<h3>Microelectromechanical System (MEMS) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Calibration Fixture</h3>
			<p>Uses an STM32 and CAN bus to control calibration of 50 IMU boards. I wrote all the calibration firmware for the IMU boards (also STM32's) and the fixture MCU.  Also developed a console based interface program in C# to communicate with the fixture over USB.  I helped design and layout the PCB.</p><br>

			<h3>Programming and Test Fixture</h3>
			<p>I helped design and layout this board, and wrote all the firmware for the STM32 MCU, also developed a console based program to interface with the board in C# over USB.</p>
			<br>
            <img src="images/prgm_fixture_empty.jpg" alt="Programming and Test Fixture" width="50%">

			<h3>Development Board</h3>
			<p>I designed and laid out the PCB.  Mainly just a development board with the UARTs and other peripherals broken out.  Also developed a Winforms GUI in C# to communicate with it over USB.</p><br>
            <img src="images/test_board.jpg" alt="Image of test board" width="50%">

			<h3>Data Logger</h3>
			<p>One my of first UIs.  Wrote this program in Java using the Swing API to log data from four integrated circuit testers simultaneously.  Eventually also converted a program written in assembly for the PIC24 on the tester (shown below) to C and added more capabilities.  I did some simple IO routing on the MAX II CPLD too.</p><br>
